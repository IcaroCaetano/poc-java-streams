# POC JAVA STREAMS

This repository contains a Proof of Concept (POC) demonstrating the practical use of three core Java functional interfaces:

- Supplier

- Consumer

- Runnable

The goal is to show how these interfaces can be combined with Java Streams and threads to build clean, expressive, and extensible processing pipelines.


## 🎯 Objectives

- Demonstrate how Supplier, Consumer, and Runnable work in isolation

- Show how they integrate naturally with Java Streams

- Highlight lazy evaluation, side effects, and task execution

- Provide a didactic and extensible POC suitable for learning or presentations

## 🧩 Supplier

#### What is it?

`Supplier<T>` represents a function that produces values without receiving any input.
